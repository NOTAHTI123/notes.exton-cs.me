    <p>The text discusses the historical shift of numerical analysts from computer science to mathematics and its impact. It mentions the creation of real-number models for computation by mathematicians like Stephen Smale. The article proposes the establishment of a new discipline within computer science called Numerical Algorithmic Science and Engineering (NAS&E) to bridge the gap between continuous and discrete computational problems. The goal is to develop a solid theoretical and practical foundation for numerical computation within computer science, integrating it with classical discrete models. The text outlines the historical background and concludes with a discussion on the role of NAS&E in computer science education and research. It encourages reoccupying the space left vacant in computer science departments after the repatriation of numerical analysts to mathematics. The article suggests readers skip the detailed historical background if they prefer and directly proceed to the main sections discussing NAS&E proposals. The reference to "GOTO 2" in Fortran language implies revisiting the historical context for a broader perspective.</p>
