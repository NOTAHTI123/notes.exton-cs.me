    <p>The text discusses the historical shift of numerical analysts from computer science to mathematics and its impact. It mentions the creation of real-number models for computation by mathematicians like Stephen Smale. The article proposes the establishment of a new discipline within computer science called Numerical Algorithmic Science and Engineering (NAS&E) to bridge the gap between continuous and discrete computational problems. The goal is to develop a solid theoretical and practical foundation for numerical computation within computer science, integrating it with classical discrete models. The text outlines the historical background and concludes with a discussion on the role of NAS&E in computer science education and research. It encourages reoccupying the space left vacant in computer science departments after the repatriation of numerical analysts to mathematics. The article suggests readers skip the detailed historical background if they prefer and directly proceed to the main sections discussing NAS&E proposals. The reference to "GOTO 2" in Fortran language implies revisiting the historical context for a broader perspective.</p>
    <p>The text delves into the historical context of numerical analysis and its relationship with computer science. It highlights the observation made by Professor Nick Trefethen that numerical analysts, initially leading computer science departments, later shifted to mathematics departments. The author notes that this shift had consequences for the mathematics of computation.

        Stephen Smale and his colleagues are credited with creating real-number, continuous models of computation as a counterpart to discrete models in computer science. Their work is outlined in the landmark monograph "Complexity and Real Computation," which introduces abstract machines defined over mathematical rings and fields. This model forms the basis for a theory of computational complexity, particularly over real and complex number fields.
        
        The text emphasizes that the solution of continuous, infinite-dimensional problems, such as partial-differential equations, is a significant focus for numerical analysts. However, it points out that these problems are often solved by reducing them to finite-dimensional problems, which remains an essential aspect of numerical analysis.
        
        The article discusses the evolving focus of numerical computation within computer science, noting an increasing emphasis on solving discrete or combinatorial problems. Despite this shift, it highlights that continuous problems, especially those defined over a real-number space of finite dimension, also fall within the scope of computer science. Examples include mixed-integer programming, network-flow programming, and dynamic programming.
        
        The downgrading of numerical analysis as a subfield of computer science is considered to have negative consequences, particularly in building a theoretical and practical foundation for numerical computation related to real numbers. The article proposes the establishment of Numerical Algorithmic Science and Engineering (NAS&E) within computer science to address this gap.
        
        The text suggests that readers can skip the detailed historical background and proceed to the main sections focusing on NAS&E proposals. It concludes with a call to reoccupy the space within computer science departments that was left vacant after the repatriation of numerical analysts to mathematics. The reference to "GOTO 2" in Fortran language suggests revisiting the historical context for a broader perspective.</p>
